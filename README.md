TrayPingAlert is a lightweight Windows utility that monitors your internet stability in real-time. It displays your current latency directly in the system tray, changes color during lag spikes, and provides a detailed hover-over graph of your ping and jitter. Perfect for gamers and remote professionals who need to keep an eye on their connection quality.


TrayPingAlert, is a handy "Internet Health Monitor" that lives in your Windows System Tray (next to your clock). It's designed for people who need to know exactly how stable their internet connection is—like gamers, remote workers, or streamers.

1. The "Live Dashboard" in your Taskbar
Instead of a boring icon, this app turns your system tray icon into a live number. This number shows your current "Ping" (how many milliseconds it takes for your computer to talk to the internet).
Green Background: Your connection is fast and healthy.
Red Background: Your connection is slow (high latency), which might cause lag in games or stuttering in video calls.


2. The Visual Health Graph
If you hover your mouse over the icon, a small, sleek black graph pops up. This shows you a history of your connection over the last few minutes. It tracks two things:
Ping (Green Line): Your overall speed.
Jitter (Orange Line): This is the most important part for stability. "Jitter" measures how much your speed is jumping around. High jitter means a "choppy" connection, even if the speed seems okay.


3. Smart Alerts
The app doesn't just watch; it warns you. If your connection suddenly gets unstable (high jitter), the icon will blink orange to grab your attention so you know why your Zoom call just froze or your game started lagging.


4. Custom Controls
By right-clicking the icon, you can tune the app to fit your needs:
Set Alert Limits: You can slide a bar to decide what "too slow" means for you (e.g., alert me if the ping goes over 50ms).
Change Target: You can tell the app which website to "test" against (by default, it checks Google's servers).
Always on Top: You can pin the graph to your screen so you can watch it while you work or play.
